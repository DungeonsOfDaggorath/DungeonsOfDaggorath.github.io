# Dungeons Of Daggorath

## Source Code / Development

The source code for Dungeons of Daggorath web port is broken into two repositories.  First, this repository is for the main website that hosts the game.  The second repository is the C++ code for Dungeons of Daggorath itself, modified for webassembly.

### Website

The website is written using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted using [GitHub](https://github.com/).

_Local Installation_

1. Clone this repository
2. [Install Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) - including any dependencies
3. Setup the C++ source code (see below)


Locally, you can test out the website using:

    bundle exec jekyll serve

### C++ Source Code

The source code is written in C++, using [emscripten](https://emscripten.org/) for the web port.

_Local Installation_

See the main repo at https://github.com/cognitivegears/DungeonsOfDaggorath for installation and development instructions

On the website, the C++ code is include in the "daggorath" submodule in the source code.  A Makefile is also included in the website version to build a new version of Daggorath for the website.  To run a build, use the following commands:

    emmake make clean
    emmake make

For more instructions on local installation, including installing dependencies, see the [main repo](https://github.com/cognitivegears/DungeonsOfDaggorath).
